## Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

### Context
You have applied the Microservices architecture pattern and the Database per service pattern. As a result, it is no longer straightforward to implement queries that join data from multiple services. Also, if you have applied the Event sourcing pattern then the data is no longer easily queried.

### Problem
How to implement a query that retrieves data from multiple services in a microservice architecture?

### Solution
Define a view database, which is a read-only replica that is designed to support that query. The application keeps the replica up to date by subscribing to Domain events published by the service that owns the data.
