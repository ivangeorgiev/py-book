## Message-Oriented Programming

**Mes­sage Ori­ented Pro­gram­ming (MOP)**. MOP is a fla­vour of object-ori­en­ted pro­gram­ming (OOP) with the core idea that your objects shouldn’t dir­ectly call each oth­er, but com­mu­nic­ate by passing mes­sages via a mes­sage bus. Mes­sages have a spe­cif­ic type and can con­tain as many argu­ments as required.
